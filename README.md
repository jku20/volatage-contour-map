After we drew our equipotential lines - all of 1-6V - we arrived at a few distinctive features: the equipotentials for 1-5V were all very stretched out across the grid, slightly bending towards the either side, and the equipotential for 6V was a very small circle. This led us to believe that the charge configuration was a point to a plate. The small 6V circle, to us, seemed to show that there was a point inside that region that supplied the eminating electric field lines, while the long 1V equipotential indicated that the other side was a long bar that could provide mostly parallel field lines. In retrospect, it was a mistake to draw the 6V equipotential line, since the battery itself was 6V. This would mean that not many points, even in a bar charge configuration, would be able to pass that necessary potential. And not drawing the circle would have perhaps had us notice that there was a very long region of 5.8+ V marked on our grid which, as a long equipotential, would have indicated a bar to us.
